        <p class="mb-12">Endless Farming is a Tool dedicated to make your live easier while playing the game Endless Frontier.
        We provide a priority system for farming Spirit Highlands (SH)
        pets that will maximize growth based on your current Knightage Level
        (KL) and available tickets, a priority system for using Unit Selection Tickets
        to maximize useful buffs, a method for tracking the number of units you
        currently have to help keep track of the buffs they provide and 
        decide which units you can afford to sacrifice when transcending artifacts, 
        and a meta page with the latest team progression guide.
        </p>
        <p>Please note that the site will save your data on this
        device, but will need to be manually entered on another device.
        Alternatively, you can export and import data to make transfering data
        easier.
